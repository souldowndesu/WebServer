# Environment Change Ledger

This ledger documents changes to server state outside the assigned Git workspace. Every planned environment or unavoidable outside-workspace change requires its own documentation-only PR.

Never record secrets or secret values.

## Baseline observed on 2026-08-24

This is an observation, not a change made by the current initialization:

- Server: Ubuntu Linux, SSH alias `aliyun-server`.
- Editable workspace: `/root/ai-workspaces/agent-1` on branch `agent-1`.
- Git remote: `https://github.com/souldowndesu/agent.git`.
- Restricted Git credential helper is configured for this repository.
- GitHub CLI access is provided by `/root/.local/bin/agent-gh`.
- Local-first uploads stage at `/root/ai-workspaces/agent-1/.cache/uploads`.

## Change records

No server environment changes were made during the workflow-document initialization.

### 2026-08-24 — Public connectivity chat on TCP 8765

- State: planned
- Owner: Agent 1
- Dedicated PR: #6
- Reason: run the merged clock page, browser chat, and HTTP API as a restartable server service and expose TCP 8765 for local-to-server connectivity tests.
- Scope (exact paths/packages/services/settings): create /etc/systemd/system/connectivity-chat.service; enable and start connectivity-chat.service; add one UFW allow rule for 8765/tcp (IPv4 and IPv6). No packages, credentials, profiles, or sibling workspaces change.
- Source URL/version/SHA-256, if applicable: no external artifact; application source is repository main merge commit 8653e1c8d06c785c462fb2813919617d464afcbb.
- Planned actions:
  1. Stage the unit only under /root/ai-workspaces/agent-1/.cache/uploads/connectivity-chat.service.
  2. Validate the staged unit with systemd-analyze verify.
  3. Install it at mode 0644 to /etc/systemd/system/connectivity-chat.service and run systemctl daemon-reload.
  4. Add UFW rule allow 8765/tcp with comment connectivity-chat.
  5. Enable and start connectivity-chat.service.
- Planned unit: runs /usr/bin/python3 -m chat_app.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765 from /root/ai-workspaces/agent-1; restarts on failure; disables bytecode writes; applies NoNewPrivileges, private temporary storage, kernel/control-group protections, restricted address families, a 128 MB memory ceiling, and a 64-task ceiling.
- Actual actions: staged the unit under agent-1/.cache/uploads with SHA-256 d026c684c09dbf7da19855cc0028d71111cd71f1d01df47c5040bcee47f1dffc; systemd-analyze accepted this unit (reported only unrelated pre-existing snapd/cloudmonitor warnings); installed /etc/systemd/system/connectivity-chat.service at mode 0644 and ran daemon-reload. Firewall and service activation were not applied because public allow-all-source TCP 8765 requires explicit user approval.
- Verification and result: unit file is installed but the service is disabled and inactive; TCP 8765 has no listener; UFW remains active with only the pre-existing 22/tcp IPv4/IPv6 rules. Public reachability and deployed local-CLI round trip remain pending explicit approval.
- Rollback: systemctl disable --now connectivity-chat.service; remove only /etc/systemd/system/connectivity-chat.service; systemctl daemon-reload; delete only the UFW 8765/tcp connectivity-chat rule; verify the unit, listener, and firewall rule are absent.
- Coordination impact: the service reads only the agent-1 checkout and does not touch agent-2. TCP 8765 becomes publicly reachable if the cloud security group also permits it. The test app is unauthenticated, unencrypted HTTP with in-memory messages only; do not send sensitive content.
